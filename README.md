# What is Selenium?
Selenium is a useful framework for test web automation as well as automation of tasks. It allows dynamic and interactive automation with the use of drivers (e.g. Selenium Webdriver).

## Selenium Webdriver
It is a selenium driver that allows native automated web interactions and support different programing languages (Java, C#, Python, Ruby and Javascript) as well as different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) through their own drivers (ChomeDriver, GeekoDriver, SafariDriver, EdgeDriver).

**Note:** firefox works without the need of installing the driver.

### Locators
Locators are used so that the desired elements can be found and the proper interaction is executed. Some commons locators are the element id, name, class_name as well as other customazible locators as CSS selectors and XPATH.

**Note:** the most common used ones are CSS selector and XPATH because of it's customazibility that allow to find complex elements in a more reliable way.
